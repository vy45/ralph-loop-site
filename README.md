# Ralph Loop Site (GitHub Pages Ready)

## Summary
This project is a polished static website that explains the **Ralph Loop** concept in a clear, practical way.

The site covers:
- What Ralph Loop is
- Its core philosophy
- How the loop works step-by-step
- Practical examples
- A clearly marked **Meta Comment** section
- **My Thoughts & How to Implement This in Project Building** with actionable guidance

The content emphasizes a pragmatic interpretation: short iterative runs, externalized memory (files/tests/git), and quality gates between iterations.
